        <h1>Oops</h1>
        <p>This website is a full fledged web application that has no backend. It
          is entirely a static website, just a bunch of files. All the logic that
          makes it useful is on the client side. This makes Javascript a true
          necessity to view this website.</p>
        <h4 class="light">All is not lost!</h4>
        <p>We are planning to support no-javascript clients in the future.</p>
